C++ Conway's Game of life on GPU
--------------------------------

This is a simple implementation of game of life using ping-pong technique for GPGPU in OpenGL. The shader used was made by Tristam MacDonnald [swiftcoder.wordpress.com](http://wp.me/pdwMN-1g). In case you wanted to build the G.O.L for yourself, link boost_chrono, boost_system, GLEW, GLUT, GL & SOIL libraries. Have fun!
